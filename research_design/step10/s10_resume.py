"""P8 resume of an interrupted or halted run -- FAIL-CLOSED. Written 2026-10-14 on the owner's instruction; NOT RUN against a provider; NOT adopted by the decision record
(MD-08 is still PENDING OWNER / ADVISOR). Tests use MockProvider only.

What the controlling text says (spec 13.8): "A run interrupted by transport failure resumes only under the identical FZ version (plus any pure implementation fix),
continuing at the next call_index of the same frozen order (no re-draw)"; "no completed call is replaced or discarded; no call is silently substituted"; "A transport-only
halt (SF1) may resume only under the identical FZ version". That is all the specification says.

What this module therefore does (explicit rule -> check):
  * same frozen order, next call_index, no re-draw: the plan is recomputed from the build (and, for main, the pilot decision record); the run's provenance entry must name the
    same call-list hash; the resumed run starts at the first call without a persisted result;
  * identical FZ version, configuration, build, authorization, evidence, settings, provider class: every one is compared with the provenance entry written before the first
    call; any mismatch refuses the resume (a pure implementation fix is allowed: the code hashes are recorded, not compared);
  * no completed call is replaced: a call with a persisted, validated raw record is never called again; a late-written ledger/calls entry for it is appended (a "reconcile"
    entry) and the record itself is not touched;
  * the earlier segment is kept: the ledger is append-only (a "resume" entry records the previous chain head, the counters carried over, the resume authorization hash and
    the previous status marker, which is MOVED into segments/, never deleted); one hash chain therefore covers the whole series.

What it does NOT decide (MD-08 open points; the code refuses instead of guessing):
  * a call with an intent entry and NO persisted raw record ("attempted, no record"): the provider may or may not have processed it. It is never repeated and the resume is
    REFUSED until the owner/advisor decides its disposition (MD-08 point 2). No disposition is implemented.
  * "transport-only": implemented as a strict allow-list (TRANSPORT_ERROR_CLASSES): the record is SF1 only, has no response text, no HTTP status and an error class on the list.
    An HTTP status error (429, 500, ...) or any other exception class is NOT treated as transport-only here, so a halt caused by it cannot be resumed. This is a provisional
    reading of an open point (C-17), not a ratified definition.
  * who may authorize: a resume needs a separate resume-authorization file written by the owner (authorized_by = owner) that names the run, its exact ledger head, the basis,
    and the number of remaining calls. The module never creates it. Whether the advisor must also approve is unconfirmed.
  * UPDATE 2026-10-15 (decision records 12.40 and 12.42): the HTTP status allow-list is EMPTY; no exception class is ratified yet (RATIFIED_TRANSPORT_ERROR_CLASSES is
    empty), so no resume after a halt is possible; a resume after a stop WITHOUT a status marker needs the persistent-evidence contract (_process_death_contract: the last
    persisted call is an SF1-only transport failure on a ratified class, and the owner's authorization names the cause and the count); a change of the driving code
    (runner, resume, integrity) needs an owner-signed H1-H4 evidence file (_check_h1_h4; H1-H3 are manual attestations, not checked by the tool). The next bullet is superseded.
  * (superseded) a run that stopped WITHOUT a status marker (process killed, power loss, sleep) was accepted only with
    resume_basis "process_interruption" and acknowledges_unspecified_basis = true written by the owner, and the entry says so.
  * counters: the consecutive-failure counter, the failure total and the call count are REBUILT from the persisted records; nothing is reset. A halt condition that still
    holds therefore fires again after the next call.
  * a run halted by the cost stop, or by anything other than rule 13.8, or a COMPLETE run, is never resumable.
  * a halt whose status marker was lost (the process died before writing it) is still a halt: when the halt rule holds on the persisted records, the resume needs
    resume_basis "transport_halt" and the same transport-only evidence; it cannot be turned into a "process_interruption" resume to get around the rule;
  * the scoring code (s10_scoring.py) must be the one named in the provenance entry: a resume never mixes two classification versions in one run;
  * a run folder is held by an operating-system lock (run.lock) while a run or a resume is alive; a resume of a live folder is refused;
  * earlier status markers kept in segments/ must still be there and unaltered, and segments/ is never overwritten.

Resume never creates evidence, authorization or decision files and never prints response text or a secret.
